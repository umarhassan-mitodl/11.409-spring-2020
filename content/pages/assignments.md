Reading Responses
-----------------

Students are asked to complete two short reading response papers, which collectively account for 20% of the grade for the course. The response papers (1 single-spaced page each) should critically engage with readings from selected weeks of the student's choosing, from week 3 through week 12, though one must be from the first part of the course and one from the second. They will be due by 11:59 PM on the Monday before class.

Final Paper (Research Proposal or Project)
------------------------------------------

The final paper (about 15–18 pages), which accounts for 50% of the grade for the course, can be written as a research proposal that critically assesses an area of interest to generate original research questions, propositions and testable hypotheses. This is intended to support first/second year papers, dissertation proposals, or chapters. Master's students have the option of doing a final project to be decided upon in consultation with the instructor.
